## Key Problems
(Discuss scipy package)

## Stakeholders
(who made scipy)

## Metrics and Features
(discuss scipy.interpolate.LinearNDInterpolator)

## Experiment
(insert images descerbe what they mean)
(extremely vague notes i wrote from talking to jed:

Look for linear and gaussian 

Compress data for non equally spaced points smooth function to evaluate accuracy

Connect smooth problem how accurate is method

Mention biases of training data

Sometimes it fills in pieces well sometimes not

What are ways it fails in surprising ways)
